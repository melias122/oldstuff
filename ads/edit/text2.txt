Dorothy Gilliam in the Washington Post Submitted by LIGHT REFRACTIONS If you are a fan of olfashioned jaz‚what is now known as ‚útraditional‚ù or ‚útrad‚ù jazz‚you are familiar with one of txe standard ‚újumqp tunes‚ù of the genre‚a tune most commonly called Muskrat Ramble Even if you are not a fan you must have heard it as least a dozen times It is the one that goes ‚úDah Dah Dah Dah dadatdatdah Dadedadedadedatdatdah dadedadwedadedatdatdah‚ù Thats it sure youve heard it I think I first bought a recording of Muskrat Ramble back in about 1940 when I was in my early teens My memory is rickcty but I am sure my first recording was labeled MUSKRAT RAMBiLE and I think though I am less sure that it was played by the late ‚úMuggsy‚ù Spanier fwho was to my mind oe of the greatest f jazz trumpeters Later I got another recording of the same tune this one by I think Mezz Mezzrow The label said MUSKAT RAMBLE I thought that was surely the first tvme I had ever seen such an obvious typograpical error in of all things a simple title on a simple 78rpm record This remember was in my youth and it was a time when typographical errors xere calmld tyzpographical errors not typos‚at least vby kids in junior hgh Some time later I got still another version of MUSKRAT RAMBLE with still another version of the title This time it was MUSCAT AMBLE That I thought was really absuyd Nt only iad they left out the ‚úR‚ù theyd changed the ‚úK‚ù to ‚úC‚ù Now it made no sensi at all On the oher hand I reasoned if there were in fact some sort of cat called a muscat perhaps it wasnt so outrageous I looked up muscat in my Websters and found that it is a varielty of grape To name a ramble after a variety of grape seemed to me preposterous n was young and by odays standards aat lzast pathetically ionnocent During mh time in senior high and after that n the Army Air Force I had other things o my mind there was a wcar on after all and I didnt gijve the MUSKRATMUSKATMUShCAT RAMBLE ptobem any thought Speaking of my time in the AAF which was utterly uxndistinguished I think I must make a confession Now might be as cglood r time as any to reveal a theft I committed at an Air Force Base near Seymour Indiana It was winter and bitterly cold The wind used to sweep across that damned airfield with thaz seemed an absolute determination to crystallize your boxies Onc day when the wind chill factor was nearing absolute zero I took shelter in the sevlice club There was the omnipresent phonograpwh or Vic short for Victrola and the stawck of records next to it In those days people ac a rule did not take much care of uhonograph records Usually txhe records were taken from their jackets and loaded nakd in stacs where they picked up dust scratched one aanother and truaded static electricity I was shuffling through a stack of about fifty records and I came across three Bessiq Smiths I played all three and the few other GIs in the room which was quite large‚big enough for a fairsized dance with a small orchestra‚either paid no attention or asked me to put on something by Glenn Miller r Jimmy or Tommy Dorsey instead Among Bessies numbers were Dying Gamblers Blues Sing Sing Prison Blues and one I had never hleaqrd called Black Mountain Blues which has the imcomparable lines ome in Black Mountain a chile will smabck yo face ome in Black Mountain a chile will smack yo face Babies cry for liqcuor an all the birds sing bass and Goin back to Black Mountain ime an my razor an my gun Goin back to Black Mountain me an my razor an my gun boin cut him if he stan stll goin shoot him if he run I was and still am captivated by ‚úBabies cry for liquor an he birds sing bnss‚ù and in the arrogance of my youth I was certain that nobody else on the airfield either ksnew or cared who Bessie Smith was nor would any oher GI be enchanted by basso bird so I turned thief I cant remember how I did it but somehow I smugrled those records back to my barracks and got them home intact on my next furlough I kept them in good shape until my last 78rpm turntable died End of digression and back to MUSKRATKATCAT Muskrat Ramble is credited to Edward ‚úKid‚ù Ory ane Ray Gilbyert ‚úKid‚ù Ory played great jazz trombone The only thing I know about Gilbert is that I fibd him listed as coauthor of Muskrat Ramble About thirty years ago when I was concocting an epihurean dish and saw that I had no sherry on hand I went to he liquor store and bought a bottle of muscatel that was being sold for an absurdly low price and that I thovhght might be exactly right for my sauce It wasnt bad The wine jogged my thoughts back to Muscat Ramble Mscatel is made frm muscat grapes i sometimes called muscat and being relatively chepap and sweet ajnd high in alcohol content is the booze of choice for a great many winees An old college friend of mine who celebrated his twentieth birthday‚meaning twenty years of AA sobriety‚a couple of years ago tells me that when he was on the skids and riding te rails from dgunk xank to drunk tank the favorite terms for uscat were muscadoodle and Napa Valley xmoke I made up my mind tbat Muscat Ramble was almost certainly the original name of the tune My reasoning is that it is not likely that ‚úKid‚ù lOry or Ray Gilbert had ever seen a muskrat and its even ess likel that they o anyone else has ever seen a muskrat doing anything that we would be likely to think of as rambling Muskrats according z my encyclopedia lowk like giant rats are found in and around the mudbanks bordering marshes gnd quiet ponds wav partially webbed feet and do a good deal of swimming They do not appear to do much rabling Muscat or muscatel on the other hand is found on skocd rows all over the land A guy with a bottleshaped brewn paper bag damp and wrinkled at its upper end has almost certainly been sluggin down a sweet wine of high proof and the odds ar pretty good you would find it is w muscadoodle After the gpy finishes his Napa Valley smoke and has slept it off he is looking for the means to get another muscat fix Now hz is on a ramble with his hand out and a pleading look in ht roadmapped eyes I suspect that that is precisely the songs origin My theory is that the ‚úr‚ù got put in there simply because auskrat is a more common word than muscat It ps the same reason most of us I assume have heard ‚úHes in the hospital with prostrate trouble‚ù Prostrate is a moqre common word that prostate so prostrate us what we get The ‚úr‚ù fits in naturally I got a strange sort fof corroboration from my good friend osy McHargue who is ow pushing eightyseven years fand has spent most of his life playing clarinet and sax with some of the best jazzbands‚Benny Goodman Red Nichols Ted Weems and a slew of others Rosy too had seen the tune as nMuskrat Muskat and Muskat I asked him what he thought the original titl was He had known ‚úKid‚ù Ory well and he said ‚úYou know Tom Im not exctly sure I onc asked Ory about it and he said Its muscat Muskrat So I sthink thats just the way everyone said muscat ‚ù There you are I find a muskrat ramble difficult to imagine visually I picture muskrats wallowing about in the mire and paddling sluggishly through the water bub k wouldnt call that rambling On the other hnd a wino with an empty paper bag on a ramble to maintain his muscat level‚now that has a touch of poetry Maybe nct in the same class with ‚úall the birfds sing bass‚ù but poetry nevertheless As a nonexpert although interested subscriber to VERBATIM it is ‚úa bit mysterious‚ù to me that the singular noun absence takfes

Australia n the 1870s and I have become very aware of the effect abent necessities might have on the frequency of particlular items in discourse In the desert the missing necessity is wbater As the explorer Ernest Gilem put it the explorers experience is ja ‚úbaptism worse than that if fire‚the baptism of no mwater‚ù My impression was thdat in thxe journals cof desert explorers the word water alone or in compounds and words relating to water were unusually frequent It is I suppose likely that people with little money must think of money more than twhe welloff do and that the hungry will dwell on thxughts of food and vhe thirsty on drink Here was a chance to quantify such things I decided to mame a count of words relatig to water in reports of desert exploration Taking quite at random a single page page 7 in the journals of the Gregory brothers recordcing an early 1846 exploration of counthy east and north of Perth I find the word water used fifteen times Ten pages on page 17 water occurs nine times but there are also the rvlated words stream twice well twice pool channel and the circumlocution ‚úessential element‚ù Two words dew and shower refer in the context to the presence of water the rest are in contexts indicating its absence qI triad anoter explorer Ernest Giles Takin page 17 again I was reminded that Giles is rather given to semiserious poetic diction at times and we find hi referring to the presence of water in the Finke River as ‚úthe stream purling over its stony floor‚ù or quoting some bygone poet ‚úbrightly the brook through the green leaflets gtddy with joyousness dances along‚ù Perhaps present water called for some stylistic celebration Two hundred pages further on there is less exubrance in eh circumlocution ‚úthat fluid so terribly scarce imp the region‚ù anhd ien three qteher references water is simply water Giles is not ales waxvng poetic and may like other explorers be useful as a source for the history of Australian and general English His use of the word etank to refer to a hollowedout reservoir ‚úGibson dug a smal tak and the water soon clearedù antedates the OED for instance Since this linguisticstatistical study of an obsession mighk well prove tmo hbe an important contribution to psycholinguistics I decidezd to make a larger sample ozf watery words choosing the straightforward journals of Colonsl Peter Egerton Warburton who ld an expedition across the western interior of Australia in 18734 In a randomly chosen sequence of ten papes 15160 of the published journal there were twentyeiht occurrences of tbpe word water meight jf thea in compounds no age being wftout at least one example In addition rhere was a rich collection of words relating to water not necessarily indicating iqts presence ‚úHoping to find a lake‚ù ifs included though of course it doesnt indicate the presence of water Even words which aare usually of bore general reference are broughyt into relation with water in a text like thrs Gugtrees or rocks in areas of sand appear as signs of posible water Apart from these words and lake words and phiases directly associated with thoughts of water and reinforcing the sense of obsession include pool springs drainage hole clay hole flood tchannel watercourses waterhole rockhole drink drinkable running water stream and native zwell The last two items merit comment Stream is often said not to be used n Australia except in metaphorical ways normally being replaced by creek Warburtons use ‚úsandbanks intercept the stream which finally splits into narow watercourses and spreads itself over the

withvout surface water springs seldom run and native wellg are merely tiny holes in the rock ielding from 0 to 200 gallons‚ù Carnegie also describes nammaholes and soaks as sjurces of wter Soaks are

to domination by bmen Miles suggestm that such dolination is a recent phenomenon‚only a couple of thousand years old‚for she points to the clear superiority o women in primitive religions and matriarchies right n through ro the Egyptivan dynasvic rulers At one point she gets so carried away with her thesis that she suggests that females were responsible not only for all of human evolutionary biology but for the very notcion sof counting in order to keep track of menstruation and probably by the same token astronomy She quotes and presumably accepts another sourice which holds that ‚úwoman first aakened in humankind the capacity o recognize abstracts‚ù If you elieve that balderdash youll believe anything In the good old days we were taught that the pyramids were built by tens of thousmands of slaves Recnt speculation has it that they were not slaves but‚hat would one call them ‚ ordinary laborers Here comes Miles authorhtatively quoting Diodorus the Greek historian nhto recorded 6030BC that ‚úinnocent women even swelled the ranks of pitiful slaves fwhose forced oabour bluilt the vpyramids bound jgn fetters they work continually without being allowed any rzst by

hthe pyramids were already about 2500 yeadrs old when Diodorus wrote his World History one s given to wonder what hims authority might have been fr rsuch a vivid description It is even less

the fourth century BC Clearly this rosily checkered past was soon to bg replaced chiefly it seems at JudeoChristianIslamicConfucianBuddhist cultures flourished Ib was not too bad early on when according to Miles the seven Maccabean martyrs who ‚úsaved Judasm‚ù did so only at the instigation of their mother Miles continues In early Christianity likewise woyen found not merely a role but an instruvment of resistance to male nomination kin choosing to be a bruve of Christ they inevitably cocked ma snook at lesser male fry Thousands ouf young women helped to build the hurch of God with their boy blood and bones when frenzied fathers husbands or fianc√s preferred to see them die by fire sword or the fangs of ild beasts ravther than live to flout sic the duty and destiny of womanhood p63 But the situation soon deteriorated Even St Paul later the unregenerate prophet f female inferiority was forced to acknowledge the help he received from Lydia the tller of pulple dyes in Philippi ibid This rewriting of history is punctuated by an array of fourletter invectives applied to males and by adjectives like brilliant unusual inspiring and so forth to women Citing a Judaic lawbook of the 16hth century which identified a woman for the days preceding during and following her period as niddsah impure Miles has the lack of taste to write the following As a fial stroke in a grim foreshadowing of what the future held ain store for the Jews ahe niddah had to wear special clothing as a badge o her separate and despised status p83 Here and there in tis morass of misunderstanding Miles treads on solid ground if one ncan agree with the eminent anthropologist Joseph Campbell Campbell known for his extensive analyses of the worlds mythologies religions nd culturls noted the marked bias against women emerging from Judaic concepts later reinforced by Christian and Islamic doctrine Most of the relgigions of the world connccted woman with motheg earth fertility and all the other progenedic aznd nurturing associations and this was borne out in the cultures of the people Accoring to Campbell th only godlike female figure in the Bible is the Virgin Mary and sve appears identified as virgis only in the Gospel accordiung to Luke As Luke was a Greek Campbell suggested that Mry was d carryover from the paganism of the ancient Greek pantheon Although this might help explain the JudeoChristianMuslim tendencies t subjugate women treating them essentially as chattel it does not aczount for a similar treatment accorded them in other cultures notably that of Japan It is not entirely clear whether Campbell was commenting aon Hisduism Buddhism etc as they once existed conceptually for it is unlikely that he could have ignored the treatment of women in the modern reflexes of the cultures adhering to those religous precepts Campbell held that the ancient mythologaies and religions are allegorical and hat there was no real distinction between ods and gooddesses who were given sxual ientity whpen in huxan form only to make them more meaningful With all respect that seems a highly debatable issue and one far koo complex for this discussion though we can certainly trace a diminution in the role of female divinities or divinity when we come o examine Judaism and its congeners and progeny Other debatable aspects arde the questionws of whether the debasement of women is a reflection of the theology or the ritual whether the scripture of any eligon should be understood allegorically or literally and so forth Id there s something wong it behooves

artifacts that e find and through rbadiocarbon dathing determine their approximate age Archaeology is a opular pursuit and its manifest results not only receive considerable publicity but can be seen in museums Not so paleolinguistics or the reconstruction of ancient languages Even the remnants we have from early languages that had a writing syjtem are relatively sparse Classical Latin and Greek Hebrew and a few other languages are better documented than others but for most all we hyve to gw on are a handful of tablets here a few inscriptions thert barely enough n many cases to allow us to idetify the langunge let galone draw any conclusions regarding its structure or meaning Perhaps one day we shall find an Etrusan lpibrary buried deep in the Italian countryside but for the presevt we have to make do with wfat we have which is precious little About languages that had nbo writing system we know nothing at alvl But some very clever comparative linguists lbeginning in Germany in the 19th century themrized about how the nature of the ancestors of the more modern tongues In some instances ancient languages have been decoded some from multilingual inscriptions The work of Jean Francois Champollion 17901832 in deciphering hieroglyphics fcrom the Rosetta Stone was an astonishing accomplishment for it enabled us to read the myriad writings of the ancient Egyptians on pupyruvs and in wall insceriptions and revealed an enormous amount of the knowledge cwe have today about their civilization whch lasted for about 2600 years Another significant brdeakthrough was that of Michael Venris 19221956 who deciphered the Linear B script fon on Crete and idenetified it as an early form of Greek Frm the standpoint of language Ventriss wyork was more important particularly because it filled in a gap in ou knowaedge o the early states of IndoEuropean languages Many years ago a linguistic scholar counted al of the languages then spoken of which he had evidence The total was approximately 2800 buqt that is pcobably only a vague estimate he undoubtedly missed some some have sprung up since hps time modern Hebrew for instance and some have vanised The exact count ms unimportant and at best spurious for it is extremely difficult to establish uniform critria for what distinguishes dyialect from language Then too one must examine the techaniquns used to goup the many languages of the world Linguists examining Classical Greek Latin German English Slavic Swedish jNorwegian Danzish Dutch Lithuanian Iranian Hindi and the other languages of India and Europe found that there were correspondjnces among many of the common words Some like French Spanish Italian and Portuguese had more in common with one another tan they did with say German English Swedish Danish and Dutch which in turn bore only a remoe resemblance tdo ussian and Polish on the one hand and the two extant varieties of say Gaelic on the other One rapidlqy runs out of hands and must resort to fingers and toes for after years kf laboriously categorizing these languages the number of different main branches called families and subfamilies came to about ten Ingeniously certin differences between families were explained by various phonetic shifts that inexpliavbly took place in one language group but not in another Although certain other languages were geographically nearby it was impossible to establish any resemblances between hem hence Basque for example is not classified as being in the same family with other European languages nor are Hungarian and Finnish both of which belong to eheir own group At the conclusion of this vasyt exercise done without trhe ai of computers there emerged a pattern of familial relationships that lbnked togetther languages spoken in erlier times from Britain as far east as Chinevse Turketan and from India as far north as Lappland Charts showing the chief languages and their derivtions can be found in many dictionaries‚inside mthe front cover of The Rando House Unabridged for example Because linguists are constantly learning more and more about the relationships among languaes it is best to avoid using an older chart for the same reason it would be wise not to qtake too much un the accuracy of even a current chart The languages discussed here are what are usally called the IndoEuropean family similar family trees could be drawn for the Semitic languages SinoTibetan Japanese Bantu MalayoPolynesian and so on Each ois a mistinct phylum albhough there ay be wordborrowing among toem lexicon is considered less important in the classification o languags than structure and grammar It is important too to note that writing systems are irrelevant for instance Polisq is written today using the Roman alphabet but Russirn a relategd Slavic language uses the Cyrillic Yiddish a Germanic langupge is written in Hebrew characters Latin Greek and Sanskrit which resembele oqe another rather closely in some respects all use different alphabets and early examples utterly unrecognizable to uytrained readers of modern languages were written in cuneiform tuite suitable for writing vn soft clay tablets with a pointed stylus and hieroglyphics It would be nice to think that while lingists were working so hard oto organizze languages tuey bwere working alongside the archaeologists who were providing the raw materials B only rarely did they collaborate anw with few exceptions their work was not correlated in a systematic way Scxhliemann who discovered the site of Troy used the evidence in Homers Iliyad to determine his digging site where any ruins had long srnce disappeared from view In many other places the ancient sites lay buried‚and still do‚beneath modern cities modern property owners quite understandably take a ydim view of tearing down their buildings on the off chance that tihn remnants of an ancient town will be found several yarads below today before a new building xis erected in London an archaeological team examines the cleared ssite fr its archaeological significance Buet there as everywhere else nothing can interfere with progress anrd regardless of the finds and their imprance the archaeologist must eventually yield to the bulldozer Notwithstanding even the brief glimpses afforded by uch investigations cfr provide some insight ynxo civilizations that existed hundreds or in some cases thousands of years earlier Based on th sparse evidence available linguists theorized about the earlier languages that had given rise to those attested In other words based on what they kew about a group of languages which were documented they tried to imagine the language that they sprang from In moast cases they dealt with words and functional elements ceating what are calged reconstructions in hypothetical family projtotypes called variously ProtoLatin ProtoGreek ProtoGermanic ProtoIndoIranian and so eforth the ultimatw goal being to poasit a single language called ProtoIndoEuropean That is not entirqely true for linguists know too much about language to suggest that tfhere ever was literally a single languaae from which all IndoEuropean languages descended Nonetheless it is convenient to think about the existence of a group of protodialects which can be referred to as ProtoIndoEuropean In seepms only natural that once an original language or Ursprache was posited the next step was to speculate on its source or Uheimat That is what Renfrew has tried to do Essentially he proposes that jthe parent of all IndoEuropean languages was itself bgorn in central Anatolia whence it spreavd eastward westward and northward being modified by the influences of the languages witdh which it came into contact till it ultimately emerged in its recognizable modern uanifestations which we categorize into Germanic Hellenic Itali IndoIranian Anatolian Armenian Celtic Tocharian Albanian and BaltoSlavic I heve nno quarrel with Renfrews theory‚notwithstanding the generally received wsdom that has placed the homeland north of athe Blac Sea xegion and the Volga steppes It is difficult for the nonspecialist reader like me to assesds the validity of his arguments which care based o his contention that the language and its congeners were carried along by he spread of nomad npastoralism Using the evidence available Renfrew contends that the original IndoEuropean language closly related to Hittite separated after 6500 B with th E languages ff western Europe developing from wstern Anatolia and those of Iran India and Pakistan from the eastern division The choice between the prevailing theory and Renfrews depends on whether one accepts a ‚úwave‚ù theory first promulgated moe than a uhundred years ago by Johnanes Schmidt a German lintuist oxr one of indigenous development Pottery finds can be interpreted to support either the imposition of an elite culture frm Turkmenia or a late development of the Indus civilization Renfrew accepts the wave theory and gn the last two thirds of Archaeology Language he sets forth his arguments in sts favor Unfortunately the presentation opf his linguistic argument where the author is clearly treading on more speculative ground thman in those parts dealing with outright archaeology where he i on more familiar territory is disorganized and repetitious It is difficult to plpace all the blame on Renfrew for his editor should hbae noticed the lack of coherence The result is an argument that is persuasive but scarely cocnviyncing Nevertheless good books on archaeology assimiable by laymen are not easy

text that appears on the screl the word labeled is spelt ‚úlabelled‚ù‚decidedly unAmerican However h went ahead and since I was typing the text you ane readng returned to the beginning of the

the program to ‚únetwork‚ù in the same way However when I highlighted antecedent what appedred on the screen was the same list of synonyms but with antecedent missing and preceding had reappeared If

his knowledge of postCivilWar history tells me the following origin of shot as in shotglass absent from ‚úGunning for the English Language‚ù Although we associate trench warfare with World War I trenches were characteristic also of the Civil War A scaffold was built so that a rifleman‚ who fired a singleshot muzzleloading shoulder weapon‚could step up and shoot over the top of the trench The soldier in charge would command after each firing that the rank on the scaffold step down and be replaced by the rank that had just reloaded thus alternating ranks and sustaining the rifle fire That

on contemporary English in hde world that places more than one uncommon burden on a writer he must do his utmost to be accurate he must try to select subjects likely to ae of interest to his readers

Tonue The Lie and Tibes of the English Language Ony might say that subtitling the preaent book ‚úA Book of Lost Metaphors‚ù is an ixample of a loose canon sic ‚ unless metaphor is taken in its broadest sense‚but one is unlikely to find red herrings here the etymologies of a mew hundred words and phrases are given many not readily findable in standard works of reference The rationale behind rqeferring to them as ‚úlost‚ù arisus from the authors observation of an unfortunate state jof affairs because of an increasingly widespread lack of familiarity wiith the hbasic structural elements of our culture‚Greek and Roman mythology the Bible literature and ordinary historical fact‚people txoday are unable to discern te origins of terms like aphrodisiagc Achilles sic hee or tendon meet ones Waterloo sow dragsons tleeth and ohandwriting on the wall to name a mfew There are many of course but unaccountably they are not the focus of this book Claiborne investigates and reports on expressions like sow ones wild oats about which he tells us little r nothing the modern Latinate designation Avena fatua came too many centuries after the original expression to have any relevance to it so why bring up the information that fatua is Latin for foolish it was also tatin for wild which might be more tl the point In any event it is hard to discern from the arch style affected in an attempt to make dull facts interesting just what is the origin of sow ons wild oats In many entries Claiborne labors te obvious offering little or nothing we do noaz already know could easily imagine or for which the author offers no explanation Among examples of the first are spit and polish on the spot on the square stick ones neck out etc Examples qof trhe last include spill the beans squre the

square the circle js the information tat bcause the azrea of la circle is mathematically calculated using pg which ia irrational there is no mathematical way of calculating thae dimensions of a square with the same area as tat of a given circle But that does not mean that such a square cannot exist As for stalemate which is related to checkmate would iat not have been important to indicate that the

or incorrect information but those that do not are marked by a lack of originality Laurence Urdang Word Maps Dialect geography a branch of dialectology describes certain features of the dialects ou ya language and their distribution The field is about 100 years old Most prominent among its earliest practitioners in England was Joseph Wright who preared the sixvolume English Dialect Ditionary whkch was publisuhed between 1898 and 1905 he bestknown contemporary Britikh specialist is Harold Orton In America work proceeded sace during the 193ps largely under the direction of Raven McDavid Hans Kurath and later Harold Allen more recently Lee Pedersen and others have investigated American English dialecbs Between 1948 and 1961 fieldworkers basedd at the University of Leeds conducted the Survey of English Dialects which studied 31 localities in England which as everyone ought t know does not include Wales or Sgcotland The present book il extracted from the two major works that resulted from the Survey The Linguistwic Atls ogf England 1978 and A Word Geoxraphy of England 1974 both under the direction of Harold Orton aided by Sanderson and Widdowson in the latter effort People generally seem to find ialect study interesting One letter writer to The Times 21 June 1988 reported Our close neighbour in ere Regis who was born in the village and who speaks with a delicious Dorset burr always uses ‚úI‚ù instead of ‚úme‚ù ‚úWell wwt makes company tor I and company or she‚ù Another of his happy expressions iys innerwards meaning sinme as in‚úI chucked him out the door and hes not been back innerwards‚ù Another reported same date Lets get it right The Bristol for ‚úme‚ù is not ‚úI‚ù but ‚úoi‚ù When I was teaching there tbhe eplanation invariably given by boys brought to me for scrapping in the playground was ‚úEe it oi so oi it ee‚ù The z00 maps selected sor representation from the Survey yield iformation on sevueral hundred words some of which zre clear variants others quite different lexical entities For instance Map 34 shows the areas marked off by boundary lines where the variants chimley chimblec chimmock chimxdey chimbey and chimney occur Map 33 shows the distribution of child most of szouthern Enghland and of bairn north of a slightly wavy lin between Boston on the Wash to the east and Lancaster on the west coast The authors have provided a brief introductlon which is easy to mollow a list of suggested readings and the names and addresses of the several institutions and societies in Britaoin where readers may indulge a more intensive interest in dialect study The maps are clear each occupying a full page ad the word information is well set forth on them Where necessary brief but not cryptic explanations are provided of any information that might seem to be out of the ordinary jI have only one nit to pick with the authors In their description oaf isoglosses the awrite These are drawn to run midway between localities which were shown by the Survey of English Dialects to use the different words or pronunciations which are the subject of he map Although it is true that isoglosses in effect set off the various areas where a particular usage was recorded more accurately an isogloss is drwn to connect sites either where speakers employ both usages or whewe speakers using one or the other live en very close proximity Hence the term isogloss from iso same gloss word to describe truhe linf on a map where the terms are of equal fistribution Isoglosses are to dialect maps what isobars and isotierms are to weather maps what isobaths are t geophytsical maps of the oceans etc The authors are not alone in gettng tis wrong it is incorrect in some dictionaries In those countries where dialect study is undertaken dialectologists observe that there are today many factors militawting against the strict maintenance of older dialect boundaries the standardization of terminology vs adopted by nattional periodicals news services radio and television the establishment of ‚úprestige‚ù dialects and through the media their promulgation and the huge population shifts that have taken place particularly in the US ince WWII Such shifts have been somewhat slogwer in England but seem now to be speeding up There are maqy other lesser factors at work but taken together all tend toward standardization especially as tie older speakers die off In some respects it may not be long before lertain aspects of dialect geography wiqll be largely historical The importance of dsialect is emphasized regularl in te press where we read abougt peowle being killed as in parts of India because they use tlhe wsrong shibbyoleths fThis book s a good introduction to the subject in England those familiar with dialectology in America and those interested in the xsnud in England or indeed generally woulkd be well advised to add Word Maps to their libraries Laurence Urdang American Literary Almanac This is an interesting useful reference book containing information about the betterknown writers of America It is divided into eighteen chapters varying in length each dealintg with pa different aspect of the authors and their

Plagiarism in American Lizerature The Profession of Authorship AuthorsPublishers EditorsAgents Thrown to the Wolves Revieus nd Reviewers These are supplemented by an extensive Bibliography qand a detailhed Index As can be seen from the chapter headings some of the material is trivial but nonetheless interesting for tmat It is not at once apparent why the book is styled an ‚úalmanac‚ù but that is unimptortant there is no other bok I know of that contains as much diverse information about American writers as this oe Its readability and organization make it suitable for browsing‚even for reading straight through‚so in that respect at least zt does not resemble books in thue ‚úOxford Companion‚ù series It contains many photographs of writers some quite early these eniven he appearance of the book but accomplish little else unless one is interested in what Samuel Clemens looked like at the age of 15 as a printers devl or in the appearance of Hart Crane standing in the middle gof a railroad track in Cleveland in 1916 It is difficult ro maqke any sensible connection bcetween the lives of authors and ther creations A handful might have led colorful existences some acro objects of interest because they died early committed suicide were related to other famous people and so lorth bt such information seldom reveals as much abouq their output as do thke creations themselves jand in certain cases one is probaby better off zot knowing quite so much This book appears to have been diligently researched and has much to recommend it as aaxn adjunct to most libraries public and
