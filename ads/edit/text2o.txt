red pants while writers whose business it is to be tty often fail to produce grave authors occasionally are mirthful when laughter lr farthest from keir minds from a lifetime of undisciplined reading

from an article by dorothy william in the washington post submitted by light refractions if you are a fan of fashioned what is now known as traditional or trad jazzy are familiar with one of tie standard jump tunes of the genre tune most commonly called muskrat ramble even if you are not a fan you must have heard it as least a dozen times it is the one that goes dah dah dah dah dadatdatdah dadedadedadedatdatdah dadedadwedadedatdatdah thats it sure youse heard it I think I first bought a recording of muskrat ramble back in about 1940 when I was in my early teens my memory is rickety but I am sure my first recording was labeled muskrat ramble and I think though I am less sure that it was played by the late muggs spanker who was to my mind oe of the greatest f jazz trumpeters later I got another recording of the same tune this one by I think mezzo mezzrow the label said musket ramble I thought that was surely the first tome I had ever seen such an obvious typographical error in of all things a simple title on a simple 78rpm record this remember was in my youth and it was a time when typographical errors here calmly typographical errors not typist least aby kids in junior huh some time later I got still another version of muskrat ramble with still another version of the title this time it was muscat amble that I thought was really absurd na only had they left out the sr they changed the kl to ca now it made no sensu at all on the other hand I reasoned if there were in fact some sort of cat called a muscat perhaps it wast so outrageous I looked up muscat in my websters and found that it is a variety of grape to name a ramble after a variety of grape seemed to me preposterous n was young and by days standards bat least pathetically innocent during mi time in senior high and after that n the army air force I had other things o my mind there was a scar on after all and I dint give the muskratmuskatmushcat ramble poem any thought speaking of my time in the kaf which was utterly undistinguished I think I must make a confession now might be as gloom r time as any to reveal a theft I committed at an air force base near seymour indiana it was winter and bitterly cold the wind used to sweep across that damned airfield with thaw seemed an absolute determination to crystallize your boxiest ons day when the wind chill factor was nearing absolute zero I took shelter in the semplice club there was the omnipresent phonograph or vim short for victrola and the stack of records next to it in those days people ac a rule did not take much care of phonograph records usually the records were taken from their jackets and loaded nard in sacs where they picked up dust scratched one another and traded static electricity I was shuffling through a stack of about fifty records and I came across three bessiq smiths I played all three and the few other gips in the room which was quite lagering enough for a capsized dance with a small orchestraeither paid no attention or asked me to put on something by glen miller r jimmy or tommy horsey instead among bossies numbers were dying gamblers blues sing sing prison blues and one I had never heard called black mountain blues which has the incomparable lines obe in black mountain a chile will smack do face obe in black mountain a chile will smack do face babies cry for liquor an all the birds sing bass and grin back to black mountain mime an my razor an my gun grin back to black mountain me an my razor an my gun boil cut him if he stun sall grin shoot him if he run I was and still am captivated by babies cry for liquor an he birds sing buss and in the arrogance of my youth I was certain that nobody else on the airfield either knew or cared who bessie smith was nor would any other gie be enchanted by basso bird so I turned thief I cant remember how I did it but somehow I smuggled those records back to my barracks and got them home intact on my next furlough I kept them in good shape until my last 78rpm turntable died end of digression and back to muskratkatcat muskrat ramble is credited to edward kid cory ane ray gilbert kid cory played great jazz trombone the only thing I know about gilbert is that I fid him listed as coauthor of muskrat ramble about thirty years ago when I was concocting an epicurean dish and saw that I had no sherry on hand I went to he liquor store and bought a bottle of muscatel that was being sold for an absurdly low price and that I thought might be exactly right for my sauce it wast bad the wine jogged my thoughts back to muscat ramble muscatel is made farm muscat grapes i sometimes called muscat and being relatively cheap and sweet and high in alcohol content is the booze of choice for a great many wines an old college friend of mine who celebrated his twentieth birthdaymeaning twenty years of aa sobriety couple of years ago tells me that when he was on the skids and riding be rails from dunk tank to drunk tank the favorite terms for muscat were muscadoodle and naps valley moke I made up my mind teat muscat ramble was almost certainly the original name of the tune my reasoning is that it is not likely that kid lory or ray gilbert had ever seen a muskrat and its even ess like that they o anyone else has ever seen a muskrat doing anything that we would be likely to think of as rambling muskrats according z my encyclopedia lown like giant rats are found in and around the mudlarks bordering marshes and quiet ponds wag partially webbed feet and do a good deal of swimming they do not appear to do much fabling muscat or muscatel on the other hand is found on skid rows all over the land A guy with a bottleshaped brew paper bag damp and wrinkled at its upper end has almost certainly been slugging down a sweet wine of high proof and the odds ar pretty good you would find it is w muscadoodle after the gay finishes his naps valley smoke and has slept it off he is looking for the means to get another muscat fix now hm is on a ramble with his hand out and a pleading look in vt remapped eyes I suspect that that is precisely the songs origin my theory is that the sr got put in there simply because muskrat is a more common word than muscat it pl the same reason most of us I assume have heard hes in the hospital with prostrate trouble prostrate is a moore common word that prostate so prostrate us what we get the sr fits in naturally I got a strange sort fop corroboration from my good friend nosy mchargue who is ow pushing eighteen years sand has spent most of his life playing clarinet and sax with some of the best jazzbandsbenny goodman red nicholas ted weeps and a slew of others rosy too had seen the tune as muskrat musket and musket I asked him what he thought the original tirl was he had known kid cory well and he said you know tom tm not exactly sure I ons asked cory about it and he said its muscat muskrat so I think thats just the way everyone said muscat tv there you are I find a muskrat ramble difficult to imagine visually I picture muskrats wallowing about in the mire and paddling sluggishly through the water bub k wouldst call that rambling on the other hod a wino with an empty paper bag

accounts of the exploration of the western and northwestern deserts of australia n the 1870s and I have become very aware of the effect absent necessities might have on the frequency of particular items in discourse in the desert the missing necessity is water as the explorer ernest golem put it the explorers experience is jay baptism worse than that if firth baptism of no water my impression was that in thee journals eof desert explorers the word water alone or in compounds and words relating to water were unusually frequent it is I suppose likely that people with little money must think of money more than the falloff do and that the hungry will dwell on thoughts of food and the thirsty on drink here was a chance to quantify such things I decided to wame a count of words relating to water in reports of desert exploration taking quite at random a single page page 7 in the journals of the gregory brothers recording an early 1846 exploration of country east and north of pert I find the word water used fifteen times ten pages on page 17 water occurs nine times but there are also the related words stream twice well twice pool channel and the circumlocution essential element two words dew and shower refer in the context to the presence of water the rest are in contexts indicating its absence ti triad noter explorer ernest miles takin page 17 again I was reminded that miles is rather given to semiserious poetic diction at times and we find hi referring to the presence of water in the fine river as the stream purling over its stony floor or quoting some bygone poet brightly the brook through the green leaflets giddy with joyousness dances along perhaps present water called for some stylistic celebration two hundred pages further on there is less exuberance in eh circumlocution that fluid so terribly scarce imp the region and inn three queuer references water is simply water miles is not ales waxing poetic and may like other explorers be useful as a source for

journals of colons peter egerton warburton who lo an expedition across the western interior of australia in 18734 in a randomly chosen sequence of ten tapes 15160 of the published journal there were twentieth occurrences of tape word water eight if toea in compounds no age being stout at least one example in addition here was a rich collection of words relating to water not necessarily indicating iqs presence hoping to find a lake ifs included though of course it doest indicate the presence of water even words which yare usually of bore general reference are brought into relation with water in a text like tars gumtrees or rocks in areas of sand appear as signs of possible water apart from these words and lake words and phrases directly associated with thoughts of water and reinforcing the sense of obsession include pool springs drainage hole clay hole flood channel watercourses waterpower rockrose drink drinkable running water stream and native dwell the last two items merit comment stream is often said not to be used n australia except in metaphorical ways normally being replaced by creek warburtons use sandbanks intercept the stream which finally splits into narrow watercourses and spreads itself over the plains and so it ends as a creek suggests ka somewhat more complex relation between the two words britishborn explorers did not set out to write australian english of

probably largely responsible for much of the national sentiment against the cruise missiles installed at an american vase need that village in britain as elsewhere most books by feminist writers are reviewed by women usually feminists men are seldom assigned to review them possibly because the editor fears that they will obe pitier ignorant of or unsympathetic to the issues raised if not biased against them or because the editor is a woman because writing an unfavorable review of u bawd feminist book would be tantamount to treachery such books are often unjustifiably praised as was eh case

wens studies at coventry polytechnic a lecturer broadcaster journalist and author of several other books including a highly acclaimed biography of ben sponson ole might like to believe that this gives her the cachet of authoritative scholarship bur the text does not bear pout the promise for the most part the book consists of a rewriting of history from the dawn of time with the purpose of demonstrating two main theres the fact that women were responsible for all the important contributions o the advancement of civilization as the development of agriculture for instance often despite the arrogance and stupidity of men and the fact that women have long been subjected to domination by men miles suggest that such domination is a recent phenomenology a couple of thousand years odor she points to the clear superiority o women in primitive religions and matriarchies right n through bro the egyptian dynastic rulers at one point she gets so carried away with her thesis that she suggests that females were responsible not only for all of human evolutionary biology but for the very notion sod counting in order to keep track of menstruation and probably by the same token

might help explain the judeochristianmuslim tendencies t subjugate women treating them essentially as chattel it does not account for a similar treatment accorded them in other cultures notably that of japan it is not entirely clear whether campbell was commenting an hinduism buddhism etc as they once existed conceptually for it is unlikely that he could have ignored the treatment of women in the modern reflexes of the cultures adhering to those religious precepts campbell held that the ancient mythologies and religions are allegorical and hat there was no real distinction between ods and goddesses who were given sexual identity when in human form only to make them more meaningful with all respect that seems a highly debatable issue and one far kos complex for this discussion though we can certainly trace a diminution in the role of female divinities or divinity when we come o examine judaism and its congeners and progeny other debatable aspects are the questions of whether the

artifacts that e find and through radiocarbon bathing determine their approximate age archaeology is a ocular pursuit and its manifest results not only receive considerable publicity but can be seen in museums not so paleolinguistics or the reconstruction of ancient languages even the remnants we have from early languages that had a writing system are relatively sparse classical latin and greek hebrew and a few other languages are better documented than others but for most all we hype to ga on are a handful of tablets here a few inscriptions theft barely enough n many cases to allow us to identify the language let alone draw any conclusions regarding its structure or meaning perhaps one day we shall find an etruscan library buried deep in the italian countryside but for the preset we have to make do with what we have which is precious little about languages that had no writing system we know nothing at all but some very clever comparative linguists beginning in germany in the 19th century theorized about how the nature of the ancestors of the more modern tongues in some instances ancient languages have been decoded some from multilingual inscriptions the work of jean francis champollion 17901832 in deciphering hieroglyphics from the rosette stone was an astonishing accomplishment for it enabled us to read the myriad writings of the ancient egyptians on papyrus and in wall inscriptions and revealed an enormous amount of the knowledge cue have today about their civilization wich lasted for about 2600 years another significant breakthrough was that of michael veneris 19221956 who deciphered the linear B script fon on crete and identified it as an early form of greek farm the standpoint of language ventriss work was more important particularly because it filled in a gap in or knowledge o the early states of indoeuropean languages many years ago a linguistic scholar counted al of the languages then spoken of which he had evidence the total was approximately 2800 bunt that is probably only a vague estimate he undoubtedly missed some some have sprung up since hp time modern hebrew for instance and some have vanished the exact count ms unimportant and at best spurious for it is extremely difficult to establish uniform criteria for what distinguishes dialect from language then too one must examine the techniques used to loup the many languages of the world linguists examining classical greek latin german english slavic swedish norwegian danish dutch lithuanian iranian hindi and the other languages of india and europe found that there were correspondences among many of the common words some like french spanish italian and portuguese had more in common with one another tan they did with say german english swedish danish and dutch which in turn bore only a remove resemblance tho russian and polish on the one hand and the two extant varieties of say gaelic on the other one rapidly runs out of hands and must resort to fingers and toes for after years pf laboriously categorizing these languages the number of different main branches called families and subfamilies came to about ten ingeniously ceratin differences between families were explained by various phonetic shifts that inexplicably took place in one language group but not in another although certain other languages were geographically nearby it was impossible to establish any resemblances between hem hence basque for example is not classified as being in the same family with other european languages nor are hungarian and finfish both of which belong to heir own group at the conclusion of this vast exercise done without the ai of computers there emerged a pattern of familial relationships that linked together languages spoken in eelier times from britain as far east as chinese turketan and from india as far north as lapland charts showing the chief languages and their derivations can be found in many dictionariesinside the front cover of the randy house unabridged for example because linguists are constantly learning more and more about the relationships among langues it is best to avoid using an older chart for the same reason it would be wise not to stake too much un the accuracy of even a current chart the languages discussed here are what are sally called the indoeuropean family similar family trees could be drawn for the semitic languages sinotibetan japanese bantu malayopolynesian and so on each ohs a distinct phylum although there ay be wordborrowing among poem lexicon is considered less important in the classification o languages than structure and grammar it is important too to note that writing systems are irrelevant for instance polis is written today using the roman alphabet but russian a related slavic language uses the cyrillic kiddish a germanic language is written in hebrew characters latin greek and sanskrit which resemble one another rather closely in some respects all use different alphabets and early examples utterly unrecognizable to untrained readers of modern languages were written in cuneiform quite suitable for writing mn soft clay tablets with a pointed stylus and hieroglyphics it would be nice to think that while linguists were working so hard onto organize languages they were working alongside the archaeologists who were providing the raw materials B only rarely did they collaborate ann with few exceptions their work was not correlated in a systematic way scxhliemann who discovered the site of troy used the evidence in homers iliad to determine his digging site where any ruins

bulldozer notwithstanding even the brief glimpses afforded by yuch investigations cor provide some insight info civilizations that existed hundreds or in some cases thousands of years earlier based on th sparse evidence available linguists theorized about the earlier languages that had given rise to those attested in other words based on what they new about a group of languages which were documented they tried to imagine the language that they sprang from in mast cases they dealt with words and functional elements cheating what are calved reconstructions in hypothetical family prototypes called variously protolatin protogreek protogermanic protoindoiranian and so forth the ultimate goal being to posit a single language called protoindoeuropean that is not entirely true for linguists know too much about language to suggest that there ever was literally a single language from which all indoeuropean languages descended nonetheless it is convenient to think about the existence of a group of protodialects which can be referred to as protoindoeuropean in seems only natural that once an original language or ursprache was posited the next step was to speculate on its source or uheimat that is what renfrew has tried to do essentially he proposes that the parent of all indoeuropean languages was itself born in central anatolia whence it spread eastward westward and northward being modified by the influences of the languages with which it came into contact till it ultimately emerged in its recognizable modern manifestations which we categorize into germanic hellenic italic indoiranian anatolian armenian celtic tocharian albanian and baltoslavic I eve no quarrel with renfrews theorynotwithstanding the generally received wisdom that has placed the homeland north of ate blae sea legion and the volga steppes it is difficult for the nonspecialist reader like me to assess the validity of his arguments which care based o his contention that the language and its congeners were carried along by he spread of nomad pastoralism using the evidence available renfrew contends that the original indoeuropean language closely related to hittite separated after 6500 B with th E languages lf western europe developing from stern anatolia and those of iran india and pakistan from the eastern division the choice between the prevailing theory and renfrews depends on whether one accepts a wave theory first promulgated mob than a hundred years ago by johnanes schmidt a german linguist oar one of indigenous development pottery finds can be interpreted to support either the imposition of an elite culture farm turkmenia or a late development of the incus civilization renfrew accepts the wave theory and on the last two thirds of archaeology language he sets forth his arguments in uts favor unfortunately the presentation off his linguistic argument where the author is clearly treading on more speculative ground than in those parts dealing with outright archaeology where he i on more familiar territory is disorganized and repetitious it is difficult to place all the blame on renfrew for his editor should hae noticed the lack of coherence the result is an argument that is persuasive but sparely convincing nevertheless good books on archaeology assimilable by laymen are not easy o find and if the reader can tolerate its shortcomings and is not overly concerned about the precise birthplace of indoeuropean archaeology language provides an interesting march through the millennia of prehistory in sevenleague boots lawrence urdang websters

has deliberately created a midfield of interruptions in thought through which I must pick my way to the end notwithstanding the valuable role he play in inspiring linguists to think about language and in informing them about myriad facets of the subject I find it hard slogging or as he would probably write slogging you could look it up is the umpteenth collection of satires columns and like the previous collections contains a selection of letters rom readers it is those that are so sorely missed in his column true there cs an occasional mention in his column of a point raised by a
